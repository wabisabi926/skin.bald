# service.webostv

A Kodi service addon that controls the LG webOS TV it runs on, matching what Home Assistant's
`webostv` integration does, over the TV's local SSAP WebSocket API. Built for Kodi 21+ running
natively on webOS (dev-mode install). It also works from Kodi on another box (CoreELEC,
LibreELEC, desktop) controlling a webOS TV on the LAN.

See [`spec.md`](spec.md) for the full design.

### On-device results

Kodi 22.0 RC1 on a separate box controlling an LG OLED77G5WUA (webOS 10.3.0, firmware 33.30.97),
driven over JSON-RPC (`JSONRPC.NotifyAll`) on 2026-10-10:

- Pairing, key storage, and reconnect after addon upgrades without re-prompting.
- `status`, `command`, `catalog`, `volume`, `mute`, `button`, `sound_output`, `toast`, `app`,
  `input`, `screen`, `power_off`, and `power_on` (Wake-on-LAN, MAC learned automatically) all
  work; bad requests are rejected before reaching the TV. Replies arrive in ~50–200 ms.
- Skin properties follow TV-side changes within about 1 s, with no polling.
- With Quick Start+ on, `power_off` puts the TV in `Active Standby` and the control connection
  stays up, so use `WebOS.On` / `WebOS.Power` (not `WebOS.Connected`) to tell if the TV is on.
- This firmware refuses plain `ws://` on port 3000; the `wss://` 3001 fallback is used.
- `getCurrentSWInformation` returns 401; firmware comes from `config/getConfigs` instead.
- Find TV lists the TV and filters out other SSDP responders (a Hue bridge).
- Not tested on hardware: following a paired TV to a new IP (the test TV has a static IP;
  covered by tests against the fake TV), and the drop/reconnect path when the TV fully
  powers off.

## Install

Build a zip and install it from Kodi (*Add-ons → Install from zip file*):

```sh
python3 scripts/build_zip.py   # -> dist/service.webostv-<version>.zip
```

Finding the TV:

- **Automatic:** with the default host (`127.0.0.1`) and nothing paired yet, if nothing answers
  locally the service searches the network (SSDP). If exactly one webOS TV answers, it connects,
  the TV shows the pairing prompt, and the TV's address is saved as the host.
- **Find TV:** *Settings → Connection → Find TV on the network* (or *Find TV* in the program
  UI) lists the TVs on the network; picking one sets the host.
- **Address changes:** if the saved address stops answering, the service searches (at most every
  2 minutes) for the TV with the same device UUID and moves to its new address, reusing the
  pairing key. It never connects to a different TV this way.

On first start the TV shows a pairing prompt; accept it. If the MAC address setting is empty, the service fills it in from
the TV's own report (wired preferred) so `power_on` via Wake-on-LAN works without typing it. The key is stored in
`special://profile/addon_data/service.webostv/client_key.json`, never in settings.

## Actions

Every action works the same from `RunScript`, keymaps, skin buttons, and JSON-RPC.

| Action | Args | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `power_off` | none | `RunScript(service.webostv,power_off)` |
| `power_on` | none (needs MAC; off-TV mode) | `RunScript(service.webostv,power_on)` |
| `screen` | `on` / `off` | `RunScript(service.webostv,screen,off)` |
| `volume` | `up`, `down`, or 0–100 | `RunScript(service.webostv,volume,25)` |
| `mute` | `on`, `off`, `toggle` (default) | `RunScript(service.webostv,mute,toggle)` |
| `input` | input id or label, case-insensitive | `RunScript(service.webostv,input,HDMI_2)` |
| `app` | app id or title, optional JSON params | `RunScript(service.webostv,app,netflix)` |
| `sound_output` | e.g. `tv_speaker`, `external_arc` | `RunScript(service.webostv,sound_output,external_arc)` |
| `button` | name from aiowebostv `buttons.py` | `RunScript(service.webostv,button,HOME)` |
| `toast` | message | `RunScript(service.webostv,toast,Hello)` |
| `media` | `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `rewind`, `fast_forward` | `RunScript(service.webostv,media,pause)` |
| `channel` | `up`, `down`, or channel id | `RunScript(service.webostv,channel,up)` |
| `picture_preset` | preset name, e.g. `filmMaker`, `cinema` | `RunScript(service.webostv,picture_preset,cinema)` |
| `next_playback` | `picture=<filmmaker\|bright\|preset>`, `screen_off`, `power_off_at_end` | `RunScript(service.webostv,next_playback,picture=filmmaker)` |
| `command` | SSAP uri, optional JSON payload | `RunScript(service.webostv,command,ssap://system/getSystemInfo)` |
| `status` | none | Shows connection, model, firmware |
| `repair` | none | Forgets the key and re-prompts on the TV |
| `setting` | setting id | Toggles an on/off setting or picks an option (skins): `rules_enabled`, `restore_on_stop`, `resume_on_return`, `transparent_control`, `toast_on_connect`, `auto_discover`, `loopback_fallback`, `debug`, `on_tv_off`, `on_switch_away` |
| `ui` | optional page: `picture_preset`, `input`, `app`, `sound_output`, `volume`, `remote`, `toast`, `status`, `find_tv`, `repair` | Opens the program UI, or one of its pickers directly (for skins) |

`RunScript` splits arguments on commas; the addon rejoins free text (toast messages, JSON
payloads), so `RunScript(service.webostv,toast,Hello, world)` works.

### Plugin: apps and inputs

`plugin://service.webostv/?view=apps` lists the TV's apps in its launcher order, `?view=inputs` its
inputs, with icons; picking an item launches it on the TV. Skins use these as widgets. The service
keeps `addon_data/service.webostv/launcher.json` current whenever the TV's lists change and caches
the icons in `addon_data/service.webostv/icons/` (downloaded from the TV's own address only; the TV
serves them over HTTPS with a self-signed certificate), so listings load instantly and still show
while the TV is off.

### JSON-RPC

External clients (Home Assistant, scripts, a phone) can drive the addon through Kodi's
notification bus:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "JSONRPC.NotifyAll",
 "params": {"sender": "service.webostv", "message": "request",
            "data": {"id": "abc123", "action": "volume", "args": ["25"]}}}
```

The service answers with a `reply` notification (`Other.reply` on the Kodi WebSocket) carrying
the same `id`: `{"id": "abc123", "ok": true, "result": ...}` or
`{"id": "abc123", "ok": false, "error": "bad_request|disconnected|command_error", "message": "..."}`.

## Picture presets and HDR rules

`picture_preset` uses the alert-to-luna workaround (see `resources/lib/luna.py`). The TV never
reports the result of that call, so the service reads the mode back and fails the action if the
TV didn't apply it, e.g. for a name the TV doesn't offer.

Preset names come from the TV (`settings/getSystemSettingDesc`). webOS keeps a separate set per
signal type: SDR names are bare (`cinema`, `filmMaker`, `expert1`), HDR10/HLG names start with
`hdr` (`hdrCinema`), Dolby Vision names with `dolbyHdr` (`dolbyHdrCinema`). The *Choose…* buttons
in settings and the *Picture preset* menu item list only the presets valid for that type.

*Settings → Playback* (off by default): set a preset per HDR type (SDR, HDR10/HDR10+, HLG,
Dolby Vision; empty = leave alone). When video starts, the service reads `VideoPlayer.HdrType`
and applies the matching preset after a short delay (default 1.5 s), so a quick stop/start
doesn't make the TV flip back and forth. When playback stops it restores the preset that was in use while
Kodi was idle. The TV keeps separate picture memories for SDR and HDR signals, so the
mode it reports at the instant playback starts isn't a safe restore target.

## TV integration

*Settings → TV integration*:

- **Kodi's TV input**: the input Kodi's box is plugged into (e.g. `HDMI_1`). Learned automatically
  when you change any addon setting (the TV must be showing Kodi then) or when a video plays;
  *Choose…* picks it from the TV's list. Not needed when Kodi runs on the TV. *Status* shows the
  learned input and whether transparent control is active.
- **When the TV turns off**: do nothing, pause, stop, or shut down. Shut down runs Kodi's own
  shutdown function (*Settings → System → Power saving*) after 20 s, and is cancelled if the TV
  comes back on. A dropped connection counts as "off" after 15 s.
- **When the TV switches away from Kodi**: do nothing, pause, or stop, when the TV moves to another
  input or app (after a 1 s settle, so passing through doesn't count). *Resume when the TV switches
  back* resumes only playback this paused.
- **Transparent control**: while the TV shows another input or app, an invisible Kodi dialog catches
  Kodi remote presses and sends them to the TV: arrows, OK, back, info, numbers, colour keys,
  playback keys, channel up/down, volume and mute. Kodi's context-menu key switches the TV back to
  Kodi (and closes the dialog). Off-TV only: Kodi on the TV gets no key presses in the background.


### Video context menu

*LG TV* submenu on movies, episodes, music videos and video files (when the TV is connected):

| Item | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Play with Filmmaker Mode | Filmmaker Mode for the video's signal (`filmMaker` / `hdrFilmMaker`; Dolby Vision falls back to Cinema) |
| Play in bright-room mode | Expert (Bright room) for SDR, Cinema Home for HDR / Dolby Vision |
| Play with picture preset… | Any preset the TV offers for this video's HDR type |
| Play with the screen off | Screen off while it plays (concerts, podcasts); back on when it stops |
| Play, then turn off the TV | Turns the TV off when the video (or playlist) finishes; not when you stop it |

Each item applies only to the playback it starts (60 s to begin), and is undone when playback stops.
They work even with the HDR rules off. Combined with *When the TV turns off: Shut down*, "Play,
then turn off the TV" also powers down the Kodi box. The same overrides are available to keymaps
and scripts as `next_playback`.

## Development

Tests run off-Kodi and off-TV with fake `xbmc*` modules and a fake SSAP server.

```sh
uv sync --python 3.11
uv run pytest -q
```

Layout notes:

- `resources/lib/vendor/` holds unmodified aiowebostv and websockets (see `VENDORED.md`).
- `resources/lib/aiohttp_shim/` provides the slice of aiohttp that aiowebostv uses;
  `bootstrap.install()` registers it as `sys.modules["aiohttp"]`.
- `resources/lib/tv.py` (`TvController`) is the only code that touches `WebOsClient`.

## Open questions

To be answered during on-device validation (milestone 5):

- Which Python version does the official Kodi 21 webOS build ship? aiowebostv needs 3.11+;
  the service logs and disables itself cleanly on older interpreters.
- Does the SSAP server accept connections on `127.0.0.1`, or only on the LAN interface?
  The service falls back to the LAN IP automatically and remembers what worked.
- Does webOS suspend or kill Kodi's process when another input or app is in the foreground?
  The service reconnects immediately once after a drop, before entering backoff.
- Does the createAlert-to-luna technique still work on current firmware? (phase 2)
- Does `VideoPlayer.HdrType` report correctly on the webOS build? (phase 2)
